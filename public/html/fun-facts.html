                <h3>🇧🇪 Belgian Origin</h3>
                <p>Despite the name "French fries," they were actually invented in Belgium! Belgians were frying potatoes as early as the 1680s. The "French" part likely comes from WWI American soldiers who first tasted them in French-speaking Belgium.</p>

                <h3>🇺🇸 Americans Love Fries</h3>
                <p>Americans eat an average of 30 pounds of French fries per person per year. That's roughly 4.5 million pounds of fries consumed every single day in the USA!</p>

                <h3>🥔 Potato Perfectionism</h3>
                <p>The perfect French fry needs to be fried TWICE! First at a lower temperature to cook the inside, then at a higher temperature to make it crispy. This is called the "double-fry method."</p>
            </div>

                <p>McDonald's alone sells over 9 million pounds of French fries globally every single day. That's enough fries to fill an Olympic swimming pool!</p>

                <h3>👨‍🍳 Thomas Jefferson's Role</h3>
                <p>Thomas Jefferson is credited with introducing French fries to America. He served "potatoes served in the French manner" at a White House dinner in 1802.</p>

                <h3>💎 Most Expensive Fries</h3>
                <p>The world's most expensive French fries cost $200 and are made with Chipperbeck potatoes, truffle oil, and edible gold dust. They're called "Crème de la Crème Pommes Frites."</p>

                <h3>🎮 Nintendo Connection</h3>
                <p>The Nintendo company started as a playing card company in 1889, but here's the twist: they once tried to expand into instant rice and even had a deal to distribute frozen French fries in Japan!</p>

                <h3>🧪 Science of Crispiness</h3>
                <p>The perfect temperature for frying is 375°F (190°C). Any lower and they absorb too much oil. Any higher and they burn. Science doesn't lie!</p>

                <h3>🏔️ Altitude Affects Fries</h3>
                <p>French fries taste different at high altitudes! Due to lower air pressure, water boils at a lower temperature, making it harder to get that perfect crispy exterior.</p>

                <h3>📏 Perfect Dimensions</h3>
                <p>Fast food chains have specific fry dimensions. McDonald's classic fries are exactly 2.5 to 3 inches long and 0.3 inches thick. Consistency is key!</p>

                <h3>🧂 Salt Statistics</h3>
                <p>A medium order of fries contains about 270mg of sodium, which is roughly 11% of your daily recommended intake. But who's counting when they taste this good?</p>
